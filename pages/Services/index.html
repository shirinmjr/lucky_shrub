            <h2>Custom Garden Design & Creation</h2>
            <p>Jason and our team create beautiful, functional gardens that thrive in the Sonoran Desert. We specialize in xeriscape principles: low-water, drought-tolerant designs using native plants, rocks, gravel, and strategic hardscaping to minimize irrigation while maximizing beauty and usability.</p>
            
            <p>From front yard curb appeal with welcoming pathways to backyard oases with seating areas, water features, or outdoor living spaces — we design spaces you'll love year-round.</p>

            <p>We handle full installation: planting, irrigation systems (drip and efficient setups), patios, pathways, retaining walls, and outdoor features. Our designs incorporate natural elements like boulders, decomposed granite, and pavers to blend seamlessly with Tucson's arid environment.</p>
