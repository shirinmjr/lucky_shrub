    <h1>About Lucky Shrub</h1>
    <p>
      Your trusted partner in creating beautiful, sustainable outdoor spaces
      in Tucson, Arizona.

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Based in Tucson, Arizona, Lucky Shrub is a medium-sized garden design
        firm that specializes in garden design and creation, maintenance, and
        landscaping. We also run a small plant nursery offering a curated
        selection of indoor and outdoor plants, making us a true one-stop shop
        for all your gardening needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our mission is simple: to help you transform any space into an oasis
        you can be proud of — whether it's a drought-tolerant desert
        landscape, a vibrant backyard retreat, or lush indoor greenery.

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Lucky Shrub was founded by a passionate husband-and-wife team, Jason
        and Maria, who have shared a lifelong love for plants and the
        outdoors.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jason is our talented garden architect. He leads the creative process,
        designing custom gardens and overseeing our skilled team of
        landscapers to bring every vision to life with precision and care.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maria handles all aspects of marketing and manages our plant nursery,
        ensuring we offer high-quality plants and excellent customer service
        to help our clients succeed in their gardening journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, we built Lucky Shrub from a shared dream into a thriving
        local business dedicated to sustainable, beautiful landscapes that
        thrive in the unique Arizona environment.
